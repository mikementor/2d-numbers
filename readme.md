### 2D numbers  
This repo represents  vizualization of numbers on 2-dimensional grid, where each cell is
``` Number =  (Value in cell) * 2^row * 3^column```
So, any number can be represented with its binary representation on the 0-th row.

This repo helps me investigate Collatz hypothesis as my small hobby.

Project uses 
- Vite
- React (for some UI)
- JS (no need for typescript)
- Tailwind css
- vitest and wallaby.js for testing
